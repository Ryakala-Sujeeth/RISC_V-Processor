## Datapath
The microprocessor's datapath includes the following stages:
### Pipeline Stages

### Instruction Fetch (IF)

- Fetches the instruction from memory.
- This stage retrieves the instruction located at the address specified by the program counter (PC). The PC is then incremented to point to the next instruction. This stage is crucial for ensuring that instructions are sequentially accessed and prepared for decoding.

### Instruction Decode (ID)

-  Decodes the fetched instruction to determine the operation, operands, destination register,memory address,addressing mode etc..
-  In this stage, the fetched instruction is decoded to identify the opcode, which specifies the operation to be performed. It also determines the source operands and the destination register. 

### Execute (EX)

- Performs the required operation on the operands.
-  This stage utilizes the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to execute arithmetic and logical operations on the source operands. It also calculates memory addresses for load and store instructions and evaluates branch conditions. The results of these operations are then prepared for the next stage.

### Writeback (WB)

-  Writes the result back to the register file or memory as per opcode.
- In this final stage, the results of the execution stage are written back to the destination register specified during the decode stage. If the instruction involves memory operations, the data is written to or read from the memory. This stage ensures that the results of the executed instruction are properly stored and made available for future instructions.

The control system manages the following states:

1. S0: Initial State (Everything off)
   
2. S1: Reset State

3. S2: Clock Signal State
 
4. S3: Halt State

## State Descriptions

### S0: Initial State
- Description: Everything is off.
- Purpose: Represents the initial state where the microprocessor and all its components are turned off.
- Actions: No operations are performed; the system is in standby mode.

### S1: Reset State
- Description: Reset all stages and enable all pipeline latches.
- Purpose: Prepares the microprocessor for operation.
- Actions: Resets all pipeline stages and enables pipeline latches.

### S2: Clock Signal State
- Description: Clock signals to latches will be sent.
- Purpose: Sends clock signals to synchronize operations across different stages.
- Actions: Distributes clock signals to latches and checks the Halt signal.

### S3: Halt State
- Description: Halt = 1
- Purpose: Pauses microprocessor operations when the Halt signal is set.
- Actions: Halts operations and waits for an external interrupt or resume signal.

## State Transitions

- S0 to S1: Microprocessor is turned on or initialized.
- S1 to S2: After resetting stages and enabling latches.
- S2 to S3: If the Halt signal is set to 1.
- S3 to S1: If a resume interrupt is received.


## Hazards and Mitigation Methods

### Hazards
Pipelining introduces several types of hazards, which can impede the smooth execution of instructions:
1. **Data Hazards:** Occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that is not yet complete.
 - **RAW hazard:** A Read After Write (RAW) hazard occurs when an instruction attempts to read a register before a preceding instruction has finished writing to that register. This can lead to the reading instruction obtaining an incorrect or stale value, affecting the correctness of the program.
 - **WAR hazard:** A Write After Read (WAR) hazard occurs when an instruction writes to a register before a preceding instruction has finished reading from that register. This can lead to the previous instruction reading an incorrect value or the write operation causing unintended side effects.
 - **WAW hazard:** A Write After Write (WAW) hazard occurs when two instructions write to the same register in a pipeline, and the order of writes can affect the final value of that register. If the second write completes before the first write, the final value written to the register might be incorrect.
2. **Control Hazards:** Occur due to jump or branch instructions that change the flow of execution.
3. **Structural Hazards:** Occur when two or more instructions require the same hardware resource simultaneously.

### Mitigation Methods

1. **Data Hazards Mitigation:**
   - **RAW hazard:** The Read After Write (RAW) hazard is mitigated by making the pipeline stages level-triggered. This ensures that if the register value changes in the middle of execution, the result in the stages gets updated accordingly.
   - **WAR hazard:** Write After Read (WAR) hazards do not occur in this processor because of sequential flow of instruction in the pipeline, which means that if instruction 1 is in the pipeline before instruction 2 then instruction 1 will write the regFile and memoryBank first then only instruction 2 can write it so, no chances of these files being written by any instruction occuring after the present instruction.
   - **WAW hazard:** Write After Write (WAW) hazards do not occur in this processor as data is written in register bank and memory only in the writeback stage which takes one instruction at a time so no two instruction can write the registers and memory simultaneously.

2. **Control Hazards Mitigation:**
   - **Pipeline Flushing:** Implemented pipeline flushing to mitigate control hazard, the jump and branch instructions with true condition sends signal to controller from writeback stage to flush the pipeline, controller then resets the IF_ID_Latch, Decode stage, ID_EX_Latch, Execute stage and EX_WB_Latch to flush the wrong instructions from the pipeline.

3. **Structural Hazards Mitigation:**
   - **Isolation of read and write signals:** Mitigated the structural hazard caused by regFile and memoryBank by isolating the read and write signals from each other. In our processor the read operation is done only in execute stage and write operation in writeback stage, both the stages works at different clock signals, so we enable read signal only when execute stage is given clock and write signal is enabled when writeback stage is given clock and instruction that require write operation is present in writeback stage.
